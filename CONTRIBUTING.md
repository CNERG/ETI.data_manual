# Contributing

This manual is a living document that improves with the contribution of others.
In order to be exhaustive, data modalities need to be added as they are
identified. There are many ventures, projects, and data streams that are
valuable to ETI and deserve to be included in the information below. Readers are
encouraged to add missing information if they believe something should be added.
Since this manual exists on GitHub, there are several methods for contribution.
This repository can be forked, edited, and contributors can send pull requests
for review. Alternatively, issues can be raised for identifying errors. For
more information on collaborating with GitHub, please refer to the [GitHub
help page](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

If a reader finds another source of data (e.g. another project or venture) that should be included in this manual,
a separate markdown page should be added that includes information on *what*
that data source provides and how to begin collaboration. Please refer to currently
including project pages as examples for formatting and content. Relevant data
streams and a row for that venture/project should also be included in the
data table below.

The data table below is not exhaustive. If a data modality is missing, please
raise an issue or pull request to add a cell, row, or column to the table.
