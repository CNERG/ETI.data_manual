# Introduction

The purpose of this manual is to provide members, particularly those from
university institutions, of the [Consortium for Enabling Technologies and
Innovation (ETI)](https://eti.gatech.edu) details for access to NA-22
relevant data from national laboratories.
Data that has been gathered with potential interest to ETI collaborators is
introduced, and instructions for accessing that data are provided.
Hopefully this will serve as a catalyst for university members, like graduate
students and their PIs, to partner with ventures at national labs that can
benefit from academic research.

This manual has been categorized in two ways. For those interested in specific
ventures or projects, the table of contents below directs to each respective
project page. In some instances, a user might be interested in a specific form
of data (imaging, audio, E&M readings, etc.) but might not be sure which venture
or project best fits those needs. To facilitate this search, a table has been
organized below that attempts to match certain forms of data with each project.
Note that this table is not exhaustive. In the event that a user finds a data
type that is not listed but should be, please create an issue or pull request
on the manual's GitHub page. To explore something in the table, each
cell forwards to information on the venture or project.

Contribution to this document is encouraged as data streams are identified.
The process of adding content is detailed in the (contributing page)[CONTRIBUTING.md]
