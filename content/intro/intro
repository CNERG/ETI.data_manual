\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this manual is to provide members, particularly those from
university institutions, of the Consortium for Enabling Technologies &
Innovation (ETI) details for collaboration with national labs.
Data that has been gathered with potential interest to ETI collaborators is
introduced, and instructions for accessing that data are provided.
Hopefully this will serve as a catalyst for university members, like graduate
students and their PIs, to partner with ventures at national labs that can
benefit from academic research.
