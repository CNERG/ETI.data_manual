\section{Multi-Informatics for Nuclear Operations Scenarios (MINOS)}

This venture under NNSA Nonproliferation Research and Development (NA-22) is
focused at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). It is dedicated towards
developing methods for identifying nuclear proliferation. To facilitate this
study, MINOS acts as a compendium of datasets collected in various forms and
at various locations. This section does not serve as an overview of the MINOS
venture and its research efforts. Instead, this section will highlight examples
of data that is collected as part of MINOS. For those interested in this data
(perhaps for use in modelling and simulations), details will be presented on
how to request access to this data and points of contact for collaboration with
MINOS.

\subsubsection{Examples of Available MINOS Data}

An ETI Thrust Area 1 collaborators may be interested in MINOS data as a means
for developing models and simulations that can be used in nonproliferation
research. As it pertains to ETI’s mission, MINOS provides real-world data, with
ground-truth for some datasets, that can confirm or inform computational models.
A brief, non-inclusive list of potential datasets are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Seismo-acoustic
\item Electro-magnetic
\item Biota
\item UHI Infrasound
\item HFIR Measurements
\item REDC Measurements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requesting Data Access}

Data is stored and managed by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL). To begin the
process, start by emailing \href{johnsonja@ornl.gov}{Dr. Jared Johnson} who is
the ETI Point of Contact for MINOS. Please state that your affiliation
(including your participation in ETI), your interest in collaboration with
MINOS, and your intended use for the data. Upon approval, you will be asked to
acknowledge and accept the MINOS Data Use Agreement. You will then be forwarded
to register an account on the MINOS database and Dr. Brian Quiter of LBL will
grant you access. Once this is complete you will be able to access, browse,
download, and use MINOS data.

\subsection{Browsing MINOS Data}

While the \href{https://minos.lbl.gov/}{MINOS website} has many useful tools,
this section serves to highlight a few. A great place to start for more
detailed instructions is at the
\href{https://minos.lbl.gov/docs/index.html}{MINOS help page} (found by going
to the \verb|Help| tab on the main page).

All datasets can be seen as a list by going to the \verb|Datasets| tab on the
webpage. This page allows keyword searches for specific datasets and has
various tags to sort data based on its relevance. Each dataset has an
affiliated organization, so selecting that on the left-hand side will filter
only that data. Clicking on an entry will open a list of files associated with
that dataset. There should be a JSON that contains summary information
about what is contained on this page. Data is commonly tarballed into a large
database format and a more reasonably sized HDF5 format. Clicking on any
of the files brings the user to a download page for manually downloading files.
Some data (for example biota) may be in another format like XLSX rather
than those explained above.

Alternatively, data can be explored using the \verb|Data Workspace| tab on the
home page. Clicking \verb|Workspace| allows the user to select any number of
different data sets for download (remember to click \verb|Save| after choosing
datasets). Once files are in the workspace, they can be selected and then
reviewed by pressing \verb|Load Data Collections|. The bottom portion of the
page acts as a staging ground before downloading files. From here, there are
three options for the user.

\subsubsection{Download all files from data collections}

Simply press \verb|Submit Query| and all files “checked” in the workspace will
be downloaded. The default file format downloaded will be the HDF5 datasets.

\subsubsection{Download individual HDF5 datasets}

This tab allows the user to individually select HDF5 files from the selected
workspace datasets for download. A valuable feature here is the ability to add
a time-selection visualization. Simply select the time filter for the datasets
and a histogram will be generated with the frequency of entries at different
time bins. This may be useful in understanding when data was being collected at
maximum capacity. Subsets of the data can be selected by dragging an interval
over the histogram. This will highlight the selection of times to be prepared
for download.

\subsubsection{Download individual non-HDF5 files}

If there are any non-HDF5 files available for download in the selected
workspace datasets, they can be specifically downloaded here.

\subsection{Python Download API}

If the user knows what data is needed, it can be downloaded without using the
website. A Python API has been created that allows a user to download directly
from code. To start, select\\*
\verb|Tools -> REST API Key Manager -> Generate New API Key|. Make sure to copy
this key down and take note of its expiration date
(new keys can always be generated). This section will not detail the rest of
the instructions for using the API. Instead, these instructions are provided in
the MINOS help documentation linked above.

This Python API can be executed from any desktop computer, but if it is more
desirable it can also be executed from a JupyterHub portal found on the webpage
at \verb|Tools -> JupyterHub Portal|. This is run on a cluster at LBL and allows
a user to create Jupyter notebooks for data analysis. When the Python API is
used here, data will be downloaded to the cluster, which may be more
advantageous than downloading directly to a desktop computer.
