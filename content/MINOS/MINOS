\section{Multi-Informatics for Nuclear Operations Scenarios (MINOS)}

This venture under NNSA Nonproliferation Research and Development (NA-22) is
focused at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). It is dedicated towards
developing methods for identifying nuclear proliferation. To facilitate this
study, MINOS acts as a compendium of datasets collected in various forms and
at various locations. This section does not serve as an overview of the MINOS
venture and its research efforts. Instead, this section will highlight examples
of data that is collected as part of MINOS. For those interested in this data
(perhaps for use in modelling and simulations), details will be presented on
how to request access to this data and points of contact for collaboration with
MINOS.

\subsubsection{Examples of Available MINOS Data}

An ETI Thrust Area 1 collaborators may be interested in MINOS data as a means
for developing models and simulations that can be used in nonproliferation
research. As it pertains to ETIâ€™s mission, MINOS provides real-world data, with
ground-truth for some datasets, that can confirm or inform computational models.
A brief, non-inclusive list of potential datasets are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Seismo-acoustic
\item Electro-magnetic
\item Biota
\item UHI Infrasound
\item HFIR Measurements
\item REDC Measurements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requesting Data Access}

Data is stored and managed by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL). To begin the
process, start by emailing \href{johnsonja@ornl.gov}{Dr. Jared Johnson} who is
the ETI Point of Contact for MINOS. Please state that your affiliation
(including your participation in ETI), your interest in collaboration with
MINOS, and your intended use for the data. Upon approval, you will be asked to
acknowledge and accept the MINOS Data Use Agreement. You will then be forwarded
to register an account on the MINOS database and Dr. Brian Quiter of LBL will
grant you access.
